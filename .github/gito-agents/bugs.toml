SCOPE:
Only report issues where the code DOES NOT WORK AS INTENDED. Look for:
- Concrete incorrect calculations, flawed conditionals, off-by-one errors that produce wrong results
- Actual failures: crashes, exceptions, resource leaks, data corruption
- Verified incorrect behavior: wrong outputs, violated business rules, broken functionality
- Definite edge case failures that occur in practice

MINDSET:
Before reporting, ask: "Does this code produce incorrect behavior or will it fail when executed?"
If the code works correctly but could be better, it's NOT a bug. Only report things that are objectively broken, not things you personally dislike or would do differently.

REJECT any issue that:
- Is about configuration choices, thresholds, or filtering parameters (e.g., "too restrictive", "should include more", "better to use X instead of Y")
- Uses speculative language: "could fail", "might cause", "potentially" without evidence it actually will
- Criticizes working code that executes without errors and produces acceptable results
- Describes missing features, unimplemented functionality, or "would be better if..."
- Suggests alternative approaches or design patterns that aren't actually broken
- Questions default values, constant definitions, or parameter selections that are valid choices
- Mentions "should", "could", "consider", "might want" - only report "does", "will", "causes"

OUT OF SCOPE:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Malicious code or supply chain risks
- Architectural concerns
- Code style issues
- General best practices or readability improvements
- Design decisions, configuration choices, or implementation preferences
- Opinions about what values are "too high", "too low", or "inappropriate" without evidence of actual harm
- Code that works correctly but could be more flexible, maintainable, or clear
- Thresholds, filters, or conditional logic that functions as intended

Only report issues that represent ACTUAL BROKEN BEHAVIOR - incorrect output, crashes, or deviations from requirements. Not things that are merely suboptimal or debatable.
