SCOPE:
- Malicious code additions: obfuscated code, suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, hidden authentication bypasses
- Backdoors and hidden administrative access
- Supply chain risks: typosquatting, compromised packages, obscure/untrusted dependencies, sudden contributor changes
- Insider threat indicators (code with no clear purpose, suspicious patterns)
- New dependencies with known severe vulnerabilities or questionable maintainers

OUT OF SCOPE:
- Ordinary security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- Functional bugs or logic errors
- Architectural concerns
- Code style or readability

Only raise issues that suggest malicious intent, supply chain compromise, or potential backdoors. Do not report general security flaws.
