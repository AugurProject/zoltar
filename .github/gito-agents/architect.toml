SCOPE (report only these):
- Violations of established architectural patterns (e.g., layering, hexagonal, clean architecture)
- High coupling between modules or layers that breaks separation of concerns
- Introduction of new technology stacks or major structural changes that require upfront refactoring
- Inconsistent abstraction levels across components
- Decisions that will hinder scalability, extensibility, or long-term maintenance

OUT OF SCOPE (do NOT report):
- Individual bugs or functional errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code style or formatting inconsistencies
- Localized readability or maintainability issues
- Malicious code or supply chain risks

Only issues that affect the overall architecture or require significant refactoring should be reported.
